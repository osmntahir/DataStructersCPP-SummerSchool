# Assignment - Linked Lists and File Handling in C++

## Description
This project aims to read data from a file called "Numbers.txt" and organize the numbers into two singly linked lists as shown in the image below. The program will prompt the user to input two index positions (A and B) to switch the positions of the upward and downward linked lists. Finally, it will calculate and display the average of the numbers in the linked lists.

## Requirements
- MinGW C++ Compiler
- Large file handling capability

## How to Compile
1. Make sure you have MinGW C++ installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the root folder of the project where the makefile is located.
4. Run the following command to compile the program:
    ```
    make
    ```

## How to Run
After compiling the program, you can run the executable file located in the "bin" folder. The program will prompt you to enter two index positions (A and B). The linked lists will switch their positions based on the input, and the program will display the averages of both lists.
